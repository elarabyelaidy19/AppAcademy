# dynamic and static language 
 - dynamic language compile and  excute programming behaviors at runtime. 
 -  static language compile and excute during compilation time.

# Reflective 
- ability of a program to maniuplate its own structure and behavior as data.

# OOP 
 - programming paradigms that privilegs objects rather tha actions and data rather than functions or logic 
 - objects are instrances of classess, contains data in fields known as atributes.
 - **incapsulation** place all the code with a particular set of data in one class 
 - **information hidden** Hide methods and data essential only to a class's internal workings.

# Multi-Paradigm
 - **Procedural programming** privileges procedure invocations, i.e., method calls. In procedural programming, the
   programmer specifies a series of procedures that operate on data structures in systematic order. 
 - **functional programming** 
   -  privilegs pure functions, those who return values only determind by the input, without  
     side effects as change in the state.
   - Adherents of functional programming conceive of computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.  
   - **anonymous functions** function that capture values in the context when they are defined.
   - **higher order functions** functions that can accept function as arguments and return functions.

# Ruby philosophy 
 'help every programmer to be productive, enjoy programming, and be happy' 

# Test-Driven Development (TDD)
TDD is a process for writing software. Its basic steps are as follows: 
- Add a test
- Run all the tests and make sure the new test fails
- Write code
- Run all the tests and make sure the new test passes
- Refactor the code.

# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
- BDD is an extension of TDD. It structures the testing process through the use of user stories - a description of the  user's use of the feature being developed. The goal of the user story is to help focus the developer on what to test and what not to test.

# Unit Test
Unit testing is a way of testing an application by breaking the application down into its smallest constituent parts and testing each part in isolation. In order to test parts of an application that rely on other code, unit tests typically use mock objects to make sure that problems elsewhere in the code won't cause the tests to mistakenly fail.

Unit testing is often automated at larger or more sophisticated companies.

Integration Test
Integration testing is a form of testing in which units of code are combined ("integrated") and the results of their interactions are tested. This type of testing is done after each of the individual units has been tested.

# Test Coverage
"Test coverage" refers to how much of a software program has been tested. This can refer to several things, including the percentage of functions that have been called by the test suite, or the percentage of statements in the code that have been executed by the test suite.
