## why use git  
 * keep track of changes 
 * multible people can work on a project at once  
 * Keep a log of changes made to a project
 * Revert the project back to a previous state if we mess something up 
 * seperate our work from others using branches 

### How git store things 
 * git stores data as a snapshot "stream of snapshots"
 * git performms most operations locally. Git is distributed but centralized.

### Three stages of git 
 * working directory: modified area 
 * add your changes to the staging area : staged 
 * commited all of the staged files and creat a snapshot : committed

#### commit: 
 * commit is a checkpoint that you can return to later if your code gets screwed up.
# master and branches 
 * **master** is pristine untouchable good version of the code and the place every FINAL change or FEATURE merged to. 
 * **branches** meant for experemintations and small changes 

# working directory and Staging area  

# branching and merging
