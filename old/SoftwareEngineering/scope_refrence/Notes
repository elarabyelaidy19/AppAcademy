Scope Notes: 
  . scope descripe the location in your program wherevarible is accesible 
  . local variables can not used and reference outside of the  methods 
  . once you define a varibles outside method you cannot reference it inside the methods and does not have access 


global variables:
  . you can creat global variables by putting a $ at the beginning of the name 
  . you can refrence global variables inside any method 
  . methods can access any glopal variables 

constants:
  . constants cannot reassigned 
  . constants defined by capitalizeing the first letter 
  . by convention we capitalize the whole name 
  . you can mutate the constant name 
  . constants used in  the global scope   


hints: 
  . use global scope sparingly to minimizing methods that referencing data that is outside of them 
  . write methods that accept data as arguments as it is explicit where the data is coming from 
  . blocks of code don't have their own scope they are really a part of the containing method's scope 


variables References:
  . mutation change the content of the variables not the memory location 
  . reassigning change the memory location 
  .
